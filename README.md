# Project 2
This project is a demo of fetching json data with a place-holder API.

The free fake api for testing and prototyping is provided by jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

This project will be utilizing `/posts`, `/comments`, and `/users`

The project is divided into two sections

# Section A

List 3 buttons at the top of the site: users, posts, and comments.
When selecting a button, it requests the associated data from the json website.
Then print a list of all the objects that are recieved.

# Section B

Keep the buttons to be displayed at the top of the page (css)
